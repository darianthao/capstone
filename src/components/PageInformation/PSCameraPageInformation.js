                        One of the greatest joys for a photographer is being in the right place at the right time to capture the perfect shot. A point-and-shoot digital camera is a popular choice for beginners and advanced photographers alike. These cameras combine speed and simplicity to ensure you won’t miss once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunities. Because the quality of compact cameras has progressed so much over the years, many people are able to take their own family photos with the help of a tripod and a timer setting. Plus, their small size and lighter weight make them easy to fit in your purse or camera bag so you’re always ready when inspiration strikes. With most models, you can use a charging cord or rechargeable batteries as a power source. With Best Buy’s wide selection of digital cameras and digital camera accessories, you’re sure to find the best compact camera for your needs. We also carry point-and-shoot instant cameras. These cameras are a fun gift for teens, because they can share prints with friends while on the go.

                        Whether you’re upgrading to a new digital compact camera or you’re buying your first point-and-shoot camera, think about what features are most important to you. Many features found in today’s point-and-shoot cameras were once available only in DSLR cameras. For instance, many point-and-shoot cameras boast Full HD video capability. Innovative technology like face detection and image stabilization are also available in some point-and-shoot cameras. Instead of adjusting lens and lighting settings before clicking the button, features like automatic focus and auto flash will help you take an optimal, high-resolution picture. You can then review your photo in the LCD window before sharing with others. You’ll find it’s so easy to take amazing pictures with your new camera that your memory cards might fill up fast; it’s a good idea to buy an extra SD card to keep in your bag so you can quickly swap them and continue snapping away. Once you get home, you can slide your SD card into a photo printer to print out all your frame-worthy shots.                     </Accordion.Body>
